 This is my python diary.
 <br>
 String are immutable , meaning you cannot change them directly
 <br>
 list is muttable and can be changes and like the append , reverse this method in list if assifn to any variable or print(collec.append(2)) it will return null 
 <br>
 tuple is fixed immutable list
 
<br> for loop ma when we put range() its basicallu range(start, stop ) but when we start with 10 and wants to go down then we cannot do range(10, 1) we also need tp put step
as range (start, stop, step) otherwise step is always + 1 so now we need -1 then range (10,1,-1)
